==============================================================================
Dynamic Lateral Response of a Monopile Foundation Subjected to Lateral Spreading
==============================================================================

#. The source code was developed by `Dr Alessandro Tombari <https://github.com/AntroxEV>`_
   (*University of Exeter*, UK) and **Dr Giovanni Li Destri Nicosia**
   (*COWI A/S*, Denmark).

#. The source code was developed as part of research funded by **COWIfonden**
   under the *Rapid Innovation Initiatives* scheme.

#. This example implements the simplified hybrid p-y spring model for liquefied
   soils proposed by Franke and Rollins (2013), which was originally implemented
   in LPILE Plus v5.0 (Reese et al., 2004).

#. The case study corresponds to Model 3b presented by Franke and Rollins (2013)
   and is based on the experimental tests conducted by Abdoun et al. (2003).

#. The source code is shown below and can also be downloaded
   :download:`here </pyExamples/PilewithDynamicPY_FRANKE_Abdoun2003_MWE.py>`.

#. Additional displacement time-history files are required to run the dynamic
   analyses. These files are available in the
   `LateralSpreadingTHs directory <https://github.com/zhuminjie/OpenSeesPyDoc/tree/master/pyExamples/LateralSpreadingTHs>`_.

#. Run the source code in your preferred Python environment to reproduce the
   plots and animations presented below.
